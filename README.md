# CS230-Portfolio-Submission

# The client for this project was The Gaming Room and they wanted me to design scale up their application from a mobile environment only to Windows, Linux and MacOS as well. They wanted to do this in order to increase their player base and expected to have a user total in the low thousands. I beleive that the highlight of this document was the UML diagram which I beleive is one of the most important aspects as it will allow the development team that works on this to know exactly how this should be coded. I think that working through this document helped solidy in my mind what the requirements of the code were and let me map out exaclty how everything would work. In order to meet the needs of the end user I ensured that we had a plan for efficient memory storage that would not affect gameplay or the performance of the clients computer as they ran the application. I also ensured we had adequte server space to ensure that we could store our information and respond to user requests in a timely manner. It is important to meet the needs of the end user when designing software because if the end user is not satisfied with the final product then it will not sell or be profitable.
